Default Namespace Selection
In our setup, each service has its own namespace, so manually selecting it doesn’t add much value.
7**It would be great if the plugin could automatically select the appropriate namespace by default.

Default Pod Selection
Most of the time, developers want to view logs for all pods of a service.
5**Selecting all pods by default (while still allowing filtering if needed) would simplify the experience.
Ideally, pod names wouldn’t need to be visible unless specifically required.

Default Container Selection
Each pod has two containers: application and istio-proxy.
5**It would be very helpful if the plugin automatically filtered out istio-proxy logs by default, showing only the main application container logs.

Log Viewer Options (Default Settings)
**3**Let us choose which options to be enabled by default. The current defaults aren’t very useful in our workflow.
**2**Add a “Wrap lines” option, long log lines make readability difficult, so line wrapping would be a big improvement.
1**Add a “Show pod names” option, to see pod names if needed.

Search / Filter Bar
**4**A simple search bar to filter logs by keywords (e.g., error, fail, etc.) would make troubleshooting much faster and more efficient.
